Accessibility in Action is a two-year initiative managed by the
[Institute for Research and Development on Inclusion and Society](https://irisinstitute.ca/) that sets out to create an
online platform which will support processes where people with disabilities have the power to make sure that policies,
programs, and services by federally regulated entities are accessible to them and respect their human rights. Current
consultation processes are built on a foundation of systemic ableismâ€”they lack accountability, follow-through, and don't
honour the expertise of people with disabilities.

The Accessibility in Action platform is co-designed and developed by the [Inclusive Design Research Centre](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/)
at [OCAD University](https://ocadu.ca).

## Technical Details

The platform is built as a progressive web application using the [Laravel 8](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x) framework.
