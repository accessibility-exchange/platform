The Accessibility Exchange is a two-year initiative managed by the
[Institute for Research and Development on Inclusion and Society (IRIS)](https://irisinstitute.ca/) that sets out to
create an online platform which will support processes where people with disabilities have the power to make sure that policies,
programs, and services by federally regulated organizations are accessible to them and respect their human rights. Current
consultation processes are built on a foundation of systemic ableismâ€”they lack accountability, follow-through, and don't
honour the expertise of people with disabilities.

The Accessibility Exchange platform is co-designed and developed by the [Inclusive Design Research Centre](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/)
at [OCAD University](https://ocadu.ca).

## Technical Details

The platform is built as a progressive web application using the [Laravel 10](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x) framework.

## Installation

For general deployment information, please see the Laravel 10.x [deployment documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/deployment).

The platform requires the following:

-   [PHP](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) >= 8.1 with [required extensions](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/deployment#server-requirements)
-   [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) >= 5.7
-   [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) >= 2.0
-   [Node](https://nodejs.org) >= 18

Optionally you may wish to install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to make node version management easier.

The deployment process should follow all the recommended [optimization processes](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/deployment#optimization).

## Development environments

In development environments, a deployment should be followed by running a fresh migration and the development database seeder:

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seeder DevSeeder
```

_**NOTE:** This will overwrite all existing database tables._

## Production environments

In production environments, a deployment should be followed by running all available migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Development

### Local Development Using Herd

Local development uses [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/docs/1/getting-started/about-herd).

1. Install [Herd](https://herd.laravel.com).
2. Install [Xdebug](https://herd.laravel.com/docs/1/advanced-usage/xdebug) or [PCOV](https://herd.laravel.com/docs/1/advanced-usage/additional-extensions) for code coverage.
3. Fork and clone the project repository (easiest with the [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/)):

    ```bash
    gh repo fork accessibility-exchange/platform --clone
    cd platform
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file from the included example file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Then, change the `APP_ENV` value to `local`:

    ```dotenv
    APP_ENV=local
    ```

5. Generate an encryption key for [CipherSweet](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-ciphersweet):

    ```bash
    openssl rand -hex 32
    ```

   Add it to your `.env` file:

    ```dotenv
    CIPHERSWEET_KEY="<your key>"
    ```

6. Install Composer and NPM dependencies:
    ```bash
    # install composer dependencies
    composer install
    # To use the version of npm specified in .nvmrc.
    # requires https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
    nvm use
    # install node dependencies
    npm ci
    ```
7. Generate an application key:
     ```bash
     php artisan key:generate
     ```

8. Create the testing env file

    ```bash
    cp .env .env.testing
    ```

    Change the `APP_ENV` value to `local`:

    ```dotenv
    APP_ENV=testing
    ```

    Change the `DB_DATABASE` value to `tae-testing`:

    ```dotenv
    DB_DATABASE=tae-test
    ```

9. Create a database for development and one for running tests:
    ```bash
    mysql -uroot -e "create database accessibilityexchange;"
    mysql -uroot -e "create database tae-test;"
    ```
10. Run the required database migrations:
     ```bash
     php artisan migrate
     php artisan migrate --env=testing
     ```
11. Download the application fonts:
    ```bash
    php artisan google-fonts:fetch
    ```
12. Tell Herd to serve the application:
      ```bash
      herd link
      ```
13. Install [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) so that you can access transactional email from the platform:
    ```bash
    brew install mailpit
    brew services start mailpit
    ```
    Then, make sure that your `.env` file contains the following values:
    ```dotenv
    MAIL_MAILER=smtp
    MAIL_HOST=127.0.0.1
    MAIL_PORT=1025
    ```
    You will now be able to access mail that the platform sends by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8025 or http://localhost:8025. For more information and additional configuration options, [read the Mailpit documentation](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit).

For comprehensive instructions, consult the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x). Here's an overview
of how some key tasks can be carried out using Herd:
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) commands may be executed by using `composer <command>`.
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) commands may be executed by using `nvm <command>`.
- [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli) commands may be executed by using `npm <command>`.
- [Artisan](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/artisan) commands may be executed by using `php artisan <command>`.

### Local development setup using docker compose:
1. Install docker according to your platform instructions found [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/accessibility-exchange/platform.git && cd platform
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file from the included example file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.local.example .env
    ```

    Then, change the `APP_ENV` value to `local`:

    ```dotenv
    APP_ENV=local
    ```

4. Generate an encryption key for [CipherSweet](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-ciphersweet):

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it alpine apk add openssl && openssl rand -hex 32
    ```

    Add it to your `.env` file:

    ```dotenv
    CIPHERSWEET_KEY="<your key>"
    ```

5. Generate your database password:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it alpine apk add openssl && openssl rand -hex 32
    ```

    Add it to your `.env` file:

    ```dotenv
    DB_PASSWORD="<your key>"
    ```

6. Generate your redis password:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it alpine apk add openssl && openssl rand -hex 20
    ```

    Add it to your `.env` file:

    ```dotenv
    REDIS_PASSWORD="<your key>"
    ```

7.  Generate an application key:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml run --rm --entrypoint '' platform.test php artisan key:generate --show
    ```

    Add it to your `.env` file:

    ```dotenv
    APP_KEY="<your key>"
    ```

8. Alter the numerical IDs that PHP will run as in the application container:
    Reason: your local directories will be mapped into the application container to allow your changes to be viewed in real time.

    Find your local user ID & GROUP (Linux & MacOS):

    ```bash
    ls -ln
    ```

    You will see output like below. In the below case user is `1000` and group id is `1001`.

    ```bash
    total 1124
    drwxr-xr-x 18 1000 1001   4096 Mar 20 12:56 app
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 1000 1001   1686 Nov  2 12:10 artisan
    ```

    Add them to your `.env` file:

    ```dotenv
    WWWUSER=<your user id>
    WWWGROUP=<your group id>
    ```

9. Re-build you application container after the `.env` file updates:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml build platform.test
    ```

10.  Start up the entire stack:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
   ```

11. If you are going to be committing code changes you will want to copy the php packages from the container and install node packages.

    ```bash
    docker cp platform.test:/app/vendor ./vendor
    nvm use
    npm ci
    ```

For comprehensive instructions, consult the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x). Here's an overview of how some key tasks can be carried out using your containers:

- Visit the site using the SSL proxy to make sure assets load [https://localhost](https://localhost).
- [Artisan](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/artisan) commands may be executed by using `docker exec --user www-data platform.test php artisan <command>`.
- [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7) commands may be executed by using `docker exec --user www-data platform.test npm <command>`.
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) commands may be executed by using `docker exec --user www-data platform.test composer <command>`.
- !(preferred way) If you want to enter the container to run commands as **www-data** user (which is best when the command will create files) then use `docker exec --user www-data -it platform.test bash`.
- If you want to enter the container to run commands as **root** user then use `docker exec -it platform.test bash`.

#### Troubleshooting

**Changes are missing in the container**

- Rebuild the container and relaunch with the following command `docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml build platform.test && docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d`.

**Cannot reach site using browser**

- Check that all containers are up and running using the following command `docker ps -a` and check for container with the name `platform.test` and check the status column to see if it says **Up**.
- If it's not up then try to check logs to see if there is an error with the command `docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs -f platform.test`.  This should help you resolve what might be missing.

### Running tests

The project uses [Pest](http://pestphp.com) for testing. For more information about testing Laravel, [read the documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/testing).

If you make changes to the database, you may need to run the migrations in the test database.

```bash
php artisan migrate --env=testing
```

### Development workflow

- This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), enforced by [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/).
    All commit messages and pull request titles must follow these standards.
- The [`dev`](https://github.com/accessibility-exchange/platform/tree/dev) branch contains features
    that have been prototyped and gone through one or more co-design sessions.
- Feature development must take place in a fork, in a branch based on the `dev` branch. Feature branches
    must be named according to the format `feat/<feature>`.
- Before opening a pull request, developers should run `composer format && composer analyze && php artisan test --coverage` to ensure that their code is properly formatted, does not cause static analysis errors, and passes tests. Depending on the code coverage, more tests may need to be written to ensure that code coverage does not drop.
- Once a feature is ready to merge into `dev`, the merge must be performed using a [squash commit](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits).
- The [`production`](https://github.com/accessibility-exchange/platform/tree/production) branch contains refined
  features that are considered production-ready.
- Prereleases must be tagged from the `dev` branch.
- Releases must be tagged from the `production` branch.

### Working with markdown

In other Laravel applications you may see methods such as [`Str::markdown()`](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/helpers#method-str-markdown)
and [`Str::inlineMarkdown()`](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/helpers#method-str-inline-markdown) used. In general we attempt
to avoid using these methods and instead favour using the provided `safe_markdown()` and `safe_inlineMarkdown` helpers. These
methods will escape HTML used in a markdown string, strip unsafe links, and escape replacements. They are also tied into
the localization system, and will populate their strings into the string packages, just as `__()` would.
The `safe_markdown()` and `safe_inlineMarkdown()` methods should not be called with `{!!  !!}` as their output will safely
pass through `{{  }}`. This provides an additional layer of protection in cases where you may have mixed types output
to the template or make a mistake.
```php
{{ safe_markdown('**hello :location**', ['location' => '**World**']) }}
{{-- <p><strong>Hello **World**</strong></p> --}}
```
If you need to unescape a replacement you can use a `!` at the start of the placeholder name (e.g. `:!placeholder`).
```php
{{ safe_markdown('**hello :!location**', ['location' => '<em>World</em>']) }}
{{-- <p><strong>Hello <em>World</em></strong></p> --}}
```
There are some cases where you may still wish to use the `Str` markdown helpers, such as when handling admin input (e.g.
resource collection information). In these special cases, make sure to call the Laravel markdown helpers with the
`config('markdown')` argument to escape HTML and remove unsafe links.
```php
{!! Str::markdown('<em>Hello **World**</em>', config('markdown')) !!}
{{-- <p>&lt;em&gt;Hello <strong>World</strong>&lt;/em&gt;</p> --}}
```

#### Mail notification templates

By default Laravel supports a mixture of markdown and HTML in mail notification templates. However, in this application
we've modified the templates to only support HTML. This aligns the behaviour of the mail templates with that of the site's
blade templates.

## Supported application environments

The application environment is set by specifying the `APP_ENV` environment variable. See [Environment Configuration](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/configuration#environment-configuration) docs for more information.

| `APP_ENV` | Description |
| --- | ---- |
| local | For local development; i.e. on a developers machine. |
| dev | For nightly builds build and deployed from the "dev" branch. |
| staging | For deploys from the "staging" branch. Used to test changes in a production like environment before going live. |
| production | For deploys from the "production" branch. The live production released code. |

Amongst other things, the application environment can be used to prevent tasks from running or requiring confirmation before running, e.g. in production running `php artisan migrate:fresh` requires confirmation. It can also be used to limit output in blade templates using the `@env()` or `@production` directives (See: [Environment Directives](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/blade#environment-directives) docs)

## Custom Artisan Commands
